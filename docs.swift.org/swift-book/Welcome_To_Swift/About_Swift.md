* Safe, fast and interactive programming language.
* Combintes the best in modern language thinking.
* Compiler is optimized for performance.
* Language is optimized for development.
* Friendly to new programmers.
* Industrial quality programming language that's as expressive as a scripting language.
* Writing Swift code in a playground lets you experiment and see the results immeidately.
* Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns :
	* Variables are always initialized before use.
	* Array indices are checked for out of bound errors.
	* Integers are checked for overflow.
	* Optionals ensure that `nil` values are handled explicitly.
	* Memory is managed automatically.
	* Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.
* Swift code is compiled and optimized to get the most out of modern hardware.
* The syntax and standard library have been designed based on the guiding priniciple that the obvious way to write code should also perform the best.
* Swift combines powerfuly type inference and pattern matching with a modern, lightweight syntax, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner.
