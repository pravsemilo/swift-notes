* General purpose programming language.
* Can be used for system programming, mobile and desktop apps and scaling up to cloud services.
* Designed to make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer.
* `Safe`
	* Most obvious way to write code should behave in a safe manner.
	* Undefined behavior is enemy of safety.
	* Opting for saftey means Swift will feel strict.
* `Fast`
	* Intended as a replacement for C based languages.
	* Performance should be predictable and consistent.
* `Expressive`
# Features
* Make code easier to read and write.
* Give the control needed in a true systems programming language.
* Supports inferred types to make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes.
* Modules eliminates headers and provide namespaces.
* Memory is managed automatically.
* No semicolon required.
* Closures unified with function pointers.
* Tuples with multiple return values.
* Generics.
* Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection.
* Structs that support methods, extensions or protocols.
* Functional programming patterns like map, filter etc.
* Advanced control flow with `do`, `guard`, `defer` and `repeat` keywords.
## Safety
* Safer than C-based languages.
* Variables are always initialized before use.
* Arrays and integers are checked for overflows.
* Swift objects cannot be `nil`.
* Trying to use a `nil` object will result in compile time error.
* `Optional` - In case where `nil` is appropriate.
